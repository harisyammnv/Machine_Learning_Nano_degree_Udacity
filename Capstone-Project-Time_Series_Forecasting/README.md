# Recruit Restaurant Visitor Forecasting with Time Series Stacking

This project is created as a part for the Machine Learning Nanodegree. This project contains the following files:

### Notebooks for Inferences
1) 1_recruit_restaurant_EDA --> Contains Extensive exploratory data analysis

2) 2_recruit_restaurant_arima_final => Benchmark SARIMAX model

3) 3_recruit_restaurant_TSCV_or_Kfold --> Minimal Feature engineering

### Final Notebook
Run this following notebook to generate the final results (saves time)

4) 4_recruit_restaurant_stack_final --> Complete Feature Engineering
